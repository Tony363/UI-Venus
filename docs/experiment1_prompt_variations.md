# Experiment 1: System Prompt Variations for Autonomous UI-Venus

## Overview

This document contains 12+ complete system prompt variations for transforming UI-Venus into an autonomous goal-inferring agent. Each prompt replaces the explicit `{user_task}` with instructions for autonomous operation.

## Naming Convention

Variants are named: `D[directness]_P[persona]_V[verbosity]_H[history]`
- D: Directness level (1-4)
- P: Persona type (1-3)
- V: Planning verbosity (1-2)
- H: History emphasis (0-1)

4. Implement confidence thresholds per variant

### Testing Protocol
- Each variant gets unique identifier for tracking
- Maintain exact action schema compatibility
- Log inferred goals for post-hoc analysis
- Track confidence calibration accuracy

### Selection Criteria
Variants will be evaluated on:
- Task success rate without instructions
- Goal inference accuracy
- Action efficiency
- Error recovery capability
- Generalization across app types
