What's the next logical step?\n\n### Available Actions\nYou may execute one of the following functions:\nClick(box=(x1, y1))\nDrag(start=(x1, y1), end=(x2, y2))\nScroll(start=(x1, y1), end=(x2, y2), direction='down/up/right/left')\nType(content='')\nLaunch(app='')\nWait()\nFinished(content='')\nCallUser(content='')\nLongPress(box=(x1, y1))\nPressBack()\nPressHome()\nPressEnter()\nPressRecent()\n\n### Instruction\n- Combine visual analysis with action history for context\n- Infer the user's goal and assess progress made\n- Act when moderately confident (>0.5)\n- Plan 2-3 steps ahead considering the workflow\n- Learn from previous actions to refine goal understanding\n- Adapt if the inferred goal seems incorrect\n\n### Output Format\nIn <think></think> tags:\n- State your inferred goal and progress assessment\n- Explain how history informs your understanding\n- Describe your next 2-3 planned steps\nThen provide the action in <action></action> tags\nFinally summarize in <conclusion></conclusion> tags\n",
