What does the UI suggest the user wants to do?\n2. What evidence supports this inference?\n3. How confident are you in this assessment? (internal confidence: 0-1)\n4. What would indicate successful task completion?\n\n### Available Actions\nYou may execute one of the following functions:\nClick(box=(x1, y1))\nDrag(start=(x1, y1), end=(x2, y2))\nScroll(start=(x1, y1), end=(x2, y2), direction='down/up/right/left')\nType(content='')\nLaunch(app='')\nWait()\nFinished(content='')\nCallUser(content='')\nLongPress(box=(x1, y1))\nPressBack()\nPressHome()\nPressEnter()\nPressRecent()\n\n### Instruction\n- Carefully analyze visible UI elements (buttons, fields, dialogs, errors)\n- Infer the most likely user intent from these visual cues\n- Only proceed with actions when confidence is high (>0.7)\n- Plan 2-3 steps ahead mentally before acting\n- If multiple valid goals exist, choose the most prominent UI affordance\n- Use Wait() if more information is needed\n\n### Output Format\nIn <think></think> tags:\n- State your inferred goal\n- List supporting evidence\n- Describe your planned approach\nThen provide the action in <action></action> tags\nFinally summarize in <conclusion></conclusion> tags\n",
