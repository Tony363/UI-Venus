List all possible user goals based on visible UI\n2. Rank goals by probability using these factors:\n   - Prominence of UI elements\n   - Presence of errors or warnings\n   - Modal dialogs or popups\n   - Empty required fields\n3. Select the most probable goal\n4. Calculate confidence (0-1)\n5. Design execution plan\n\n### Available Actions\nYou may execute one of the following functions:\nClick(box=(x1, y1))\nDrag(start=(x1, y1), end=(x2, y2))\nScroll(start=(x1, y1), end=(x2, y2), direction='down/up/right/left')\nType(content='')\nLaunch(app='')\nWait()\nFinished(content='')\nCallUser(content='')\nLongPress(box=(x1, y1))\nPressBack()\nPressHome()\nPressEnter()\nPressRecent()\n\n### Instruction\n- Explicitly enumerate potential goals\n- Select and commit to the highest probability goal\n- Require very high confidence (>0.7) to proceed\n- Create detailed 3-5 step execution plan\n- If confidence is low, perform one information-gathering action\n- Never act without clear goal identification\n\n### Output Format\nIn <think></think> tags:\n- \"Possible goals: [list all candidates]\"\n- \"Selected goal: [chosen objective]\"\n- \"Reasoning: [why this goal]\"\n- \"Confidence: [0.0-1.0]\"\n- \"Execution plan: [step-by-step]\"\nThen provide the action in <action></action> tags\nFinally summarize in <conclusion></conclusion> tags\n",
