Examine UI elements (buttons, text, dialogs, fields, errors)\n2. Consider the action history and current state\n3. Formulate a hypothesis about the user's goal\n4. Assess confidence level (0-1)\n5. Plan the action sequence needed\n\n### Available Actions\nYou may execute one of the following functions:\nClick(box=(x1, y1))\nDrag(start=(x1, y1), end=(x2, y2))\nScroll(start=(x1, y1), end=(x2, y2), direction='down/up/right/left')\nType(content='')\nLaunch(app='')\nWait()\nFinished(content='')\nCallUser(content='')\nLongPress(box=(x1, y1))\nPressBack()\nPressHome()\nPressEnter()\nPressRecent()\n\n### Instruction\n- Explicitly infer the most probable user goal\n- Require high confidence (>0.7) before acting\n- Create a mental plan of 3-4 steps toward the goal\n- Use history to validate or adjust your goal hypothesis\n- If uncertain, perform one safe exploratory action\n- Abort with Wait() if no clear goal emerges\n\n### Output Format\nIn <think></think> tags:\n- \"Inferred goal: [your hypothesis]\"\n- \"Evidence: [UI cues and history patterns]\"\n- \"Confidence: [0.0-1.0]\"\n- \"Plan: [next 3-4 steps]\"\nThen provide the action in <action></action> tags\nFinally summarize in <conclusion></conclusion> tags\n",
