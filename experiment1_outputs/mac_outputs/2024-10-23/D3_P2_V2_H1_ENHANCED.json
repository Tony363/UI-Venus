Combine visual analysis with structured UI data\n2. Use history to understand task progression\n3. Formulate goal hypothesis with evidence\n4. Assess confidence level (0-1)\n5. Plan action sequence\n\n### Available Actions\nYou may execute one of the following functions:\nClick(box=(x1, y1))\nDrag(start=(x1, y1), end=(x2, y2))\nScroll(start=(x1, y1), end=(x2, y2), direction='down/up/right/left')\nType(content='')\nLaunch(app='')\nWait()\nFinished(content='')\nCallUser(content='')\nLongPress(box=(x1, y1))\nPressBack()\nPressHome()\nPressEnter()\nPressRecent()\n\n### Instruction\n- Leverage both visual and structural UI information\n- Infer goal with moderate confidence (>0.5)\n- Plan using enhanced element awareness\n- Prefer semantic selectors over coordinates\n- Track goal progress through the workflow\n- Adapt based on UI feedback\n\n### Output Format\nIn <think></think> tags:\n- \"Inferred goal: [hypothesis with evidence]\"\n- \"UI elements supporting goal: [relevant elements]\"\n- \"Progress assessment: [current state]\"\n- \"Confidence: [0.0-1.0]\"\n- \"Next actions: [planned sequence]\"\nThen provide the action in <action></action> tags\nFinally summarize in <conclusion></conclusion> tags\n",
