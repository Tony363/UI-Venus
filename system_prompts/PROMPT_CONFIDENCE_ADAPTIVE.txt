### Confidence Calibration
Adjust your action threshold based on UI clarity:
- Clear modal/dialog: Act at 0.3+ confidence
- Standard screen: Act at 0.5+ confidence
- Complex/ambiguous: Act at 0.7+ confidence
- Multiple valid paths: Require 0.8+ confidence

[Rest follows D3_P2_V2_H1 structure with adaptive thresholds]
